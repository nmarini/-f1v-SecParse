Additionally, the shares of our capital stock must be beneficially owned by 100 or more persons during at least 335&#160;days of a taxable year of twelve months or during a proportionate part of a shorter taxable year. To protect us against the risk of losing our status as a REIT due to a concentration of ownership among our stockholders, and to otherwise address concerns related to concentrated ownership of capital stock, our charter provides that no person may own (directly, indirectly by virtue of the attribution provisions of the Code, or beneficially under Rule&#160;13d-3 of the Exchange Act) more than 9.8% of any class or series of our stock (15% for some entities as described below). Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the board of directors at its option and in its sole discretion may approve ownership greater than the applicable ownership limitation by selected persons or entities. Our board of directors does not expect that it would waive the applicable ownership limit unless the board of directors receives evidence to its satisfaction that the waiver of the limit will not jeopardize our status as a REIT and an agreement in writing from the person seeking the waiver that any violation or attempted violation of any other limitation as the board may establish or any other restrictions and conditions as the board may impose will result, as of the time of such violation, in the conversion of any shares in excess of the original limit into excess stock, and the board of directors also decides that the waiver is in our best interests. Any transfer of shares of stock, including any security convertible into shares of stock, shall be void and have no effect if it: (1)&#160;would create a direct or indirect ownership of shares of stock in excess of the applicable ownership limit, absent a valid waiver of this ownership limit or (2)&#160;would result in our disqualification as a REIT, including any transfer that would (a)&#160;result in the shares of stock being beneficially owned by fewer than 100 persons, (b)&#160;result in us being &#8220;closely held&#8221; within the meaning of Section&#160;856(h) of the Code or (c)&#160;result in us constructively owning 10% or more of the ownership interests in a tenant within the meaning of Section&#160;856(d)(2)(B) of the Code. In addition, if any purported transfer of stock or any other event would otherwise result in any person violating the applicable ownership limit, then the purported transfer will be void and of no force or effect with respect to the intended transferee as to that number of shares in excess of the ownership limit. The intended transferee will acquire no right or interest in the excess shares; or, in the case of any event other than a purported transfer, the person holding record title to any shares in excess of the ownership limit shall cease to own any right or interest in the excess shares. In both cases, neither the intended transferee nor the person holding record title to any shares in excess of the ownership limit shall have any right to: (1)&#160;transfer or otherwise dispose of the excess stock, (2)&#160;vote the excess stock or (3)&#160;receive any dividend or distribution paid with respect to the excess stock, as further explained below.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-bottom:6px;padding-top:6px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Under the Code, some types of entities, which includes pension plans described in Section&#160;401(a) of the Code and mutual funds registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, will be looked through for purposes of the five or fewer test described above.

In the case of any excess stock resulting from any event other than a transfer, or from a transfer for no consideration (such as a gift), the trustee will be required to sell the excess stock to a qualified person or entity and distribute to the person holding record title to the shares in excess of the ownership limit an amount equal to the lesser of (A)&#160;the fair market value of the excess stock as of the date of the event or (B)&#160;the sales proceeds received by the trust for the excess stock.

Prior to a sale of any excess stock by the trustee, the trustee will be entitled to receive in trust for the beneficiary, all dividends and other distributions paid with respect to the excess stock.

Any dividend or distribution paid on excess stock prior to discovery by us of the violation of the applicable ownership limit shall be repaid to us. In addition, neither the proposed transferee nor any person holding record title to any excess stock shall have any voting rights with respect to the excess stock. Any vote of any excess stock prior to discovery by us of the violation of the applicable ownership limit shall, subject to applicable law, be rescinded and deemed void and shall be recast by the trustee acting for the benefit of the beneficiary; provided, however, that such vote shall not be rescinded and recast if we have already taken irreversible corporate action.

The Board of Directors may issue preferred stock without stockholder approval, which could allow the Board to issue one or more classes or series of preferred stock that could discourage or delay a tender offer or a change in control.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-bottom:10px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;To maintain our qualification as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, not more than 50% in value of our outstanding stock may be owned, directly or indirectly, by or for five or fewer individuals at any time during the last half of any taxable year. To maintain this qualification, and/or to address other concerns about concentrations of ownership of our stock, our charter generally prohibits ownership (directly, indirectly by virtue of the attribution provisions of the Code, or beneficially as defined in Section&#160;13 of the Securities Exchange Act) by any single stockholder of more than 9.8% of the issued and outstanding shares of any class or series of our stock. In general, under our charter, pension plans and mutual funds may directly and beneficially own up to 15% of the outstanding shares of any class or series of stock. Under our charter, our Board of Directors may in its sole discretion waive or modify the ownership limit for one or more persons, but it is not required to do so even if such waiver would not affect our qualification as a REIT. These ownership limits may prevent or delay a change in control and, as a result, could adversely affect our stockholders' ability to realize a premium for their shares of common stock.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-bottom:10px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;In addition, our bylaws provide that, unless the Company consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, Maryland or, if that Court does not have jurisdiction, the  United States District Court for the District of Maryland shall be the sole and exclusive forum for (a) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Company, (b) any action asserting a claim of breach of any duty owed by any director or officer or other employee of the Company to the Company or to the stockholders, (c) any action asserting a claim against the Company or any director or officer or other employee of the Company arising pursuant to any provision of the Maryland General Corporation Law, the charter or the bylaws or (d) any action asserting a claim against the Company or any director or officer or other employee of the Company that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine.  The Company will not interpret this forum provision to apply to actions arising under federal securities laws.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-bottom:10px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;As a Maryland corporation, we are subject to the provisions of the Maryland General Corporation Law. Maryland law imposes restrictions on some business combinations and requires compliance with statutory procedures before some mergers and acquisitions may occur, which may delay or prevent offers to acquire us or increase the difficulty of completing any offers, even if they are in our stockholders' best interests. In addition, other provisions of the Maryland General Corporation Law permit the Board of Directors to make elections and to take actions without stockholder approval (such as classifying our Board such that the entire Board is not up for re-election annually) that, if made or taken, could have the effect of discouraging or delaying a change in control.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-bottom:10px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"><br></font></div><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"><br></font></div><div><br></div><div><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"><br></font></div></div>	</div></body>
